# Lifesaver-AmbulancePositioningSystem-EmergencyAlert

An intelligent emergency response system that leverages **Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE)** to optimize ambulance positioning, generate real-time alerts, and coordinate with hospitals and traffic departments for life-saving impact.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Every second counts in a medical emergency. The **LifeSaver** system aims to reduce ambulance response times by:
- Clustering accident-prone zones using **unsupervised generative learning (VaDE)**
- Strategically **placing ambulances** in high-risk zones
- Sending **real-time alerts** to hospitals and traffic departments for **faster route clearance**

This system is specifically designed for India's **National Highways** in coordination with **NHAI**, traffic departments, and hospitals.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🚨 Identify high-risk accident zones
- 🚑 Optimize ambulance deployment using VaDE clustering
- 📡 Implement real-time alert system
- 🏥 Enable hospital & traffic department coordination
- 🧠 Use AI to predict ambulance dispatch decisions
- ⏱️ Minimize emergency response time and **save lives**
